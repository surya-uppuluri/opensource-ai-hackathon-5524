# Step 2: Dataset Preparation
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess dataset (e.g., remove stopwords, lowercase, etc.)
# ...

# Step 3: Feature Extraction using Langchain
from langchain import Langchain

# Initialize Langchain model
langchain_model = Langchain()

# Extract features from indicators
features = langchain_model.extract_features(dataset['indicator_text'])

# Step 4: Model Training
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split dataset into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, dataset['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train RAG model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Evaluation
# Evaluate model performance
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 6: Deployment
# Deploy model into production
# Ensure integration of Milvus and Langchain for efficient storage and retrieval
# ...
